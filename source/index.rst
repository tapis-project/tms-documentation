What is Tapis v3
________________

**Tapis** is an NSF-funded web-based API framework for  securely  managing  computational  workloads  across
infrastructure  and  institutions,  so  that  experts  can  focus  on  their research  instead  of  the  technology
needed  to  accomplish  it.  As part of work funded by the National Science Foundation starting in 2019, Tapis is
delivering a version 3 (“v3”) of its platform with several  new  capabilities,  including  a  multi-site  Security
Kernel, Streaming  Data  APIs,  and  first-class  support  for  containerized applications.

This documentation describes **Tapis v3**, the latest version of the project. If you are looking for documentation on the curent production Tapis v2 platform, please go here_.
