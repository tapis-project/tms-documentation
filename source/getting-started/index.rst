Quickstart
==========

The no-installation way to try out TMS server is to run its Docker container in MVP mode and install the KeyCmd on a host machine on which you have an account.  Refer to :ref:`docker_server_label` to learn how to run the TMS server locally. If you have Rust already installed or are willing to install it, then see :ref:`native_server_label` to learn how to build and run the TMS server natively. In either case, see :ref:`server_config_label` on how to configure it in MVP mode.  

To actually login to a host using TMS dynamic key distribution, see :ref:`keycmd_label` to learn how to install the KeyCmd module on a host and to :ref:`keycmd_config_label` on how to configure it.
