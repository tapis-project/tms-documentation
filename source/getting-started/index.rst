Quickstart
==========

The easiest way to try out TMS is to run its Docker container in MVP mode and install the KeyCmd on a host machine on which you have an account.  Refer to :ref:`docker_server_label` to learn how to run the TMS server locally and :ref:`server_config_label` on how to configure it in MVP mode.  Refer to :ref:`keycmd_label` to learn how to install the KeyCmd module on a host and to :ref:`keycmd_config_label` on how to configure it.
